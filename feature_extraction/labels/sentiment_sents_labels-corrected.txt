286;The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power, as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time.;;0
287;Even more baffling is that it's funny.;;0
288;Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material, but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core.;;0
